# Deploying-CAD-disease-Prediction
Deploying-CAD-disease-Prediction is a “Coronary Artery Disease Prediction” allows user to predict whether the person has defective heart or non – defective heart.
It is a WEB application. The main problem of coronary artery disease is a heart attack.
The main objective of this project is to check whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with any cardiovascular heart diseases based on their medical attributes
such as gender, age, chest pain, fasting sugar level, etc.
This helps in early prediction of the disease .
This project makes use of Machine Learning classification algorithm which works efficiently to find the person has defective heart or not. 
The users can get their results as soon as they fill the attributes. This website is developed using the languages Python, 
Streamlit framework integrates the model and user interface. It is a framework which is used to implement the webpage with python.
It also makes use of the Machine Learning algorithm Logistic Regression which is a classification model used to classify the model and predicts the output.
